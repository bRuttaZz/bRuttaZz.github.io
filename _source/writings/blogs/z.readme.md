The Ground Rules

1. Only files with `.md` extensions will be considered for page rendering
2. Pages will be ordered in the alphabetic order of the file names
3. All `.md` files should follow the file name convension : `<alphabetic pattern for ordering>.<name>.md`
4. The first comment inside each `.md` file will be considered as the preview heading
5. The second comment inside each `.md` file will be considered as the preview short summary (tldr)
6. The only acceptable format for comments is as follows,
    [//] # (Comment comes here)
7. All the files starts with `a*.` will be considered as pinned articles, and will be previewed in the about page
8. Files starts with `z*.` wont be rendered at all, (they are secret comments)

That's it happy blogging..
