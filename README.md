Nothing but my personal webpage

Find it over [here (brutt.site)](https://bruttazz.github.io)

**NB**: For better SEO and noscript rendering (and of course for serving using github, under limited proxy conf support), this website is maintained as a multipage app :) 

### Navigating the project dir
By nature, the repo root directory itself is containing script generated htmls (build files). Find the source files under `src` directory.
