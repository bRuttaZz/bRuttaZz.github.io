    Broadly speaking, I'm just a random lad from Kerala, born about

    <i>Malayalam</i> and <i>English</i>, and 5 computer languages:
    <i>Python</i>, <i>JS</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>Go</i> and <i>Ruby</i>. If we ever
    meet with enough time and tea (..and whatever things are required for you to

        I was a hardcore science enthusiast from my primary school days, a
        physics enthusiast to be specific. I'm the kind of person who gets
        easily amazed by some simple, cool natural phenomena.

        It was back then, when I was doing some simulation for my physics
        mini-project on

        >, that I was drawn into the realm of computer science and programming
        in general. Since then, I’ve been building some
        useless-but-otherwise-cool-for-me stuff to fulfill my temporary personal
        needs (at that time, also to impress my ex-girlfriend).

        As a netizen once famously said:
        <i>

    <p class="paragraph">
        I found programming to be a good way to satisfy my
        instant-gratification-monkey (I mean my brain)! Like any other
        passionate developer out there, I also love FOSS/FLOSS and am highly
        motivated by its philosophies. Thanks to GNU and Linux.

                I love music and sounds in general, and secretly try to learn
