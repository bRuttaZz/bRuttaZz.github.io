                            <strong>Is life simply a function of time?</strong>
                            This question had troubled me deeply for quite some
                            time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let me detail; By the late 1700s, classical
                            mechanics had grown enough that most physicists at
                            that time believed that every secret in physics had
                            almost been figured out, and only some detailed
                            explanations were left for some physical phenomena.
                            That belief naturally led to the question: if
                            everything in this world can be completely described
                            using the laws of classical mechanics, can we
                            predict the future with it?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For instance, using the laws of classical mechanics,
                            we can determine the exact location and momentum of
                            an atom in the next instant, provided we know the
                            exact initial conditions. As one can see, the
                            atmosphere, nature, the stars, and everything else
                            is made up of such particles. This implies we can
                            predict the fate of all of these things, assuming we
                            know the initial conditions. <br />It even applies
                            to complex biological beings. From our hunger and
                            appetite to our emotions and deeds, and even the
                            next word I'm going to type on my computer,
                            everything can be described as an aftereffect of
                            previous events from the surroundings, hormonal
                            states, neural activity, etc. (As there is no strong
                            evidence of God, let's ignore that for now).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In general, we could predict the whole universe if
                            we were able to know the initial conditions or state
                            of the entirety. The French scholar
                            <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace"
                                >Pierre-Simon Laplace</a
                            >
                            was the first to popularize this idea. He said that
                            if there is a being (let me call it a demon) that
                            knows the complete state of the universe, including
                            the exact momentum and position of every molecule,
                            and has enough computational ability to process this
                            information using the laws of science, it could
                            describe the future as clearly as the past. This
                            conceptual being is known as
                            <strong>Laplace's Demon</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was during my high school years that I stumbled
                            upon these ideas as part of my daydreaming (I didn't
                            know about Laplace's Demon at that time). I suddenly
                            became really upset, wondering if everything in this
                            world can technically be predicted, does it mean the
                            whole world is just a function of time? No matter
                            what we do, if we could take a snapshot of the
                            future, everything would be the same because our
                            actions are merely extensions of our previous state.
                            Whether we are lazy or motivated, everything seems
                            to be just a function of time. If we knew the
                            initial state of the universe, the state at any
                            particular time, our lives would only depend on one
                            parameter: <strong>time</strong>. If that's the
                            case, there is nothing in this world we can do to
                            change our destiny.

                        <h3>Really?</h3>
                        <p>
                            After a few months, we started learning
                            <strong>Thermodynamics</strong>, which was a delight
                            for me, as it helped me find some satisfying answers
                            to this quest. Trust me it's fun..

                            Suppose, Laplace's Demon is true, then the graph
                            showing the amount of information versus time for
                            the universe will look like the one shown bellow,

                        <p>
                            i.e., from the existing state of the universe and a
                            set of equations and formulas, the demon can predict
                            the future. Therefore, no new information is added,
                            meaning the curve should run parallel to the time
                            axis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wait, what does 'information' mean here? Well, it
                            can be defined as the facts/data regarding
                            something. In other terms, information can be
                            understood as a measure of how random an object is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, let's take a sentence, say
                            <code>I love you</code>. If we disregard grammar, we
                            can compress this sentence to <code>I lv u</code>. I
                            could convey the same message to my imaginary
                            girlfriend with this shortened version, if my
                            intention is only to transmit the information. Here,
                            we have stripped away redundant elements from the
                            language code, yet the information remains intact.
                            This suggests that information can be seen as the
                            essential data that persists when all unnecessary
                            factors and patterns are removed from the original
                            one. The remaining data may appear completely
                            random, without any patterns. Therefore, one could
                            define information of an object as a measure of its
                            randomness 🤯. (Yes, this is a super simplified
                            explanation of information theory. anywho, feel free
                            to find more about it

                            >). In physics, randomness of a system is often
                            quantified using Entropy. So,
                        </p>

                </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            The point is, if Laplace's Demon is possible, then
                            the entropy of the universe should remain constant,
                            as shown in the figure.

                            we are not living in such a universe. <br />In our

                            a function of time (at least we cannot predict it
                            with time alone). <br />And the future cannot be
                            predicted.
