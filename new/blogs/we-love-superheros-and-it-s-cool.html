                        <p>
                            It all started with a business idea. My friends
                            Dhanjay and Indraja were developing this badass
                            business idea to thrive in this chaotic world.
                            Actually, I’m about to disclose their million-dollar
                            business plan (Sorry dears, I just want to tell this
                            story rn :).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The idea is simple, there’s a bunch of stuff on
                            Alibaba, sold in bulk for dirt-cheap prices (say,
                            5rs or something to a USB-C to A cable.. (yes, I
                            mean that cheap! (I know, there are a lot of
                            brackets to close, bear with me, I’m a programmer,
                            I’m supposed to be good at that..))).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time, these exact things are sold with
                            different logos on other e-commerce sites like
                            Amazon, Flipkart, etc by resellers, for a huge
                            margin. Sometimes up to 100x the price of the
                            original (I’m not joking). Basically, these
                            resellers are making a lot more money without adding
                            much to the product’s value.
                        </p>
                        <p>So why can't we be one of them?</p>
                        <p>
                            "Seems immoral", I said.. "Why should it be immoral?
                            A lot of guys are doing it, right?" (That's how our
                            daily argument started that day.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My point was this (BTW, we'ill be exploring only my
                            POV over their's, as it's you know, my blog afterall
                            ;). By being an intermediary between the producers
                            and consumers, all we're doing is increasing the
                            visibility of the resold product and helping the
                            customers discover and buy it (kind of a help to the
                            producers). And in this particular case, we'd be
                            also doing a bulk buy, covering export duty charges
                            and miscellaneous additional costs for each product,
                            so that the customer doesn’t have to worry about
                            those.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the actual problem was in the pricing. Comparing
                            with the current business scene, we see such
                            products being sold for a high price. Sometimes,
                            electronic accessories that cost around 5rs might be
                            resold in the 100rs to 300rs range, that’s about 20
                            to 60 times the actual price.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That sounds pretty immoral, right? Right..? Not
                            convinced yet..? Let me explain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Say we are creating an e-commerce website to sell
                            such items to people. Customers are okay with
                            purchasing a USB-C to A cable for about 300rs from
                            us. Compared to other products in the market that
                            feels like a reasonable price.. right?
                        </p>
                        <p>Really?</p>
                        <p>
                            According to us, the resellers, we bought it for
                            about 5rs. Maybe, adding export and logistics
                            charges, plus some company maintenance costs and
                            all, I might have to add another 5 to 10rs per
                            product (maximum, prolly). Even so, we’ve only
                            increased the price by 100 to 200 percent (1 to 2
                            times the original price).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now let’s add our greedy additional amount. For the
                            maximum greediness, let’s say I add up to 5rs more
                            (I can't agree to more than that). I mean, I just
                            said 100% of the original product price. That’s
                            already more than the original producer might ever
                            get for this product.. (maximum greedy one should
                            ever try to be, without being super evil, I mean, at
                            least that’s where I draw the line.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Summing up, we simply made a 5rs product into a 20rs
                            one, satisfying our greedy soul (to a bigger
                            extent).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, let’s say we’re selling it for a “medium
                            feasible” amount in the market. Say, 300rs. (As of
                            today’s estimate, such a cable can cost from 53rs to
                            490rs, all the way up to ~2000rs, for high-end,
                            brand-value-added crap.)
                        </p>
                        <p>Is it moral to do that??</p>
                        <p>
                            I think, no! Maybe let’s ask a simple question;
                            should resellers ever have the moral right to get a
                            profit margin above 100% of the original price? (I’d
                            say they don’t even have the right to gain above
                            50%, at max.) Sadly, we live in a capitalist world
                            (something that evolved over time), and that’s just
                            how things are here..
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I got you guys, you might be asking “It’s up to the
                            customer, right? They can buy it or leave it…”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So here’s another clear-cut question: suppose you
                            created a full price breakdown, all the way from
                            production to delivery, detailing all the greedy
                            pocket money you're making per purchase. And publish
                            it in the website with each product. Now, after
                            reading this, and knowing there’s this site called
                            Alibaba selling it for 5rs, will the customer still
                            buy the product? Well, will the majority of
                            customers still be willing to buy it? If they ever
                            did, I might have to say, that’s a reasonable price
                            for that product. No more arguments!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But in reality, I don’t think that’ll be the case.
                            If so, we’re fooling the customers by hiding the
                            details.
                        </p>
                        <p>..and, THAT is immoral.</p>
                        <p>
                            Okay, good speech, but what about Apple selling a
                            60W USB-C charge cable (1m long) for 1679.97rs (as
                            of 7th Sep 2025, without import charges and tax)? Is
                            that fair?? NO! I never justified it either. Even
                            adding the baseline manufacturing cost and the
                            overhyped-so-called-niche-tech they inject into this
                            "wire", the price is still 100 times below the
                            greedy profit tag they slap on it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (I mean, I don’t have the exact data, but how in
                            this world could a mass-produced copper wire with a
                            tricky end, combined with some USB standard’s
                            copyright cost and some packaging, end up costing
                            this much? Think about it, you can buy a
                            high-quality-niche-end wired IEM for that price
                            within the same market (too mcuh for a USB cable..))
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I know you know: the world is hecked up. We’ve got
                            shitty politics and the worst economy in this 2025..
                            But this, this is purely evil. The low-profile
                            option you’ve got to be less evil in this society is
                            simply to not be part of such evil work

                            IDK who said it first.)

                        <p>
                            Okay, that’s all fine... But the so-called
                            capitalist economy is something that evolved over
                            time, right?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, it is; but the fact that it evolved over time
                            doesn’t make it good! What about all the other
                            naturally evolved traits like patriarchy,
                            caste/religious systems, corrupted politicians,
                            murderers and thieves, and dirty-business-people (I
                            only meant "dirty" business people).. Are all they
                            good??

                        <p>
                            But does it make any sense at all? Why should I ever
                            try to make this world a better place? Will anybody
                            care? Even if we stay real, will our neighbor ever
                            stay real for us when it’s their turn?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, I guess so! Not just a guess, I got proof. What
                            about superhero movies? A self-proclaimed masked
                            vigilante goes and saves other people around them,
                            uses his/her superpowers to do good things (maybe
                            only to do good things) for society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Statistically speaking, those movies and comics are
                            all-time favorites and hits. I think most of my pals
                            secretly think they’re Batman, deep inside...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why should we, the <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>,
                            ever celebrate a movie telling the story of a hero?
                            I think deep down, we like to love each other, even
                            if they don’t love us back (maybe yet another
                            evolutionary advantage).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s not just about celebrating the movies. All of
                            us want to become that someone sometimes! Even if
                            we’re putting on a mask, even if we’re in great
                            sorrow, even if the whole world is throwing crap at
                            us, there’s this little part in us that loves to
                            protect our tribe. Love/care, whatever you call it,
                            I guess that’s what makes us, us. (No, I didn't
                            meant the U.S. :)
                        </p>
                        <p>And hence, I love people who love superheroes.</p>
